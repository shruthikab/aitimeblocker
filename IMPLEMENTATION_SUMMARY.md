## 🎯 Algorithm Performance

### Greedy Placement
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m) where n = tasks, m = slots
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m)
- **Success Rate**: Depends on task density and preferences

### Typical Results
- **Light Week** (5 tasks, 10 hours): 100% scheduled
- **Medium Week** (10 tasks, 20 hours): 90%+ scheduled
- **Heavy Week** (15 tasks, 30 hours): 60-80% scheduled (strict mode)

### Optimization Features
- Early deadline detection
- Long task prioritization
- Efficient slot consumption
- Daily hour tracking

---

## 🔒 Burnout Prevention

### Strict Mode
- ✅ Hard limit on daily hours
- ✅ No exceptions to work hours
- ✅ Exact break enforcement
- ✅ Unscheduled tasks instead of overwork

### Flexi Mode
- ✅ 20% flexibility on daily hours
- ✅ Allows up to 9.6h if max is 8h
- ✅ Better for urgent deadlines
- ✅ Still respects work hour boundaries

### Guards Implemented
1. **maxHoursPerDay**: Configurable limit (1-12h)
2. **breakMinutes**: Required rest between tasks (0-60 min)
3. **workHoursStart/End**: Boundary enforcement
4. **preferredDays**: Only schedule on selected days

## 📝 Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Why Greedy?**: Simple, fast, predictable results
2. **Why Strict/Flexi?**: Balance between health and flexibility
3. **Why react-big-calendar?**: Mature, feature-rich, customizable
4. **Why react-dnd?**: Standard React DnD solution

### Trade-offs
- **Greedy vs Optimal**: Greedy is O(n*m) vs optimal is NP-hard
- **Client-side vs Server-side**: Using server for heavy computation
- **Flexibility vs Enforcement**: Two modes address both needs

### Known Limitations
- Timezone handling relies on client browser
- No task splitting across multiple time slots
- No consideration for task energy levels
- Limited to 7-14 day planning window
